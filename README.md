# Hack Me!

This is my attempt at an HTTPS server in C++. However, I suck at coding so this is probably pretty insecure. Not to mention the code is just out there. So, hack me!

When this is deployed I'll leave some secret in the server it's deployed on. If you can find a way to go get it (and I'm sure you can) please send it to me and I'll buy you a cookie.
